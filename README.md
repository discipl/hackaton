# Blockchainhackathon.eu Track: Reinventing Government

__The goal: discipl, a distributed information network for the commons__

In our opinion a distributed information network for the commons should harness the following aspects to be able to even start addressing problems effectively with it:

__Smart Linked Datasources :__ the platform should enable you to store information through standard API's provided by smart contracts which run in an autonomous way within the platform. The smart contracts are uniquely identifiable and like in Linked Data form ontological subjects and therefore store the corresponding subject-predicate-object triples linked to users of the platform (people and things) and make this information available for combination and processing with other data. See http://semanticblocks.wordpress.com for more inspiration on this.

__Privacy :__ the platform should enable individuals (and things) to have themselves safely and uniquely identified within the platform with multifactor authentication and enable them to create different persona's privately but immutably linked to this core identity for specific uses. Smart Linked Datasources them self keep track of who (which persona) is eligible to view or edit information. Information stored in the platform is highly encrypted in a quantum computing resistant manner. Note that there's a strong link with the Identity track here!

__Open Source :__ besides that the dutch government actually obligates this for obvious reasons it is a deal breaker if the workings of such an important platform is not as transparent as possible. Discipl is therefore made available under a Creative Commons license. It should be effectively audited too of course.

__Free :__ it should be easy and free for anyone, citizens and organizations, to use this platform on any reasonable device including smart phones. The platform enables this new economic arena for new business models in which consumers can be producers and vice versa supporting all kinds of cooperation’s. There will still be room for customers that want to pay. The platform itself however should be kept free like the air we breath.

__Scalable :__ Small devices can be nodes. The more nodes the platform consists of, the more capacity for storing and processing information it should have. It should let your device do at least twice as much work for others (in an automated way) as you are requesting from the platform yourself to make this possible for instance. Look at Tangle (https://github.com/iotaledger) or Tribler (https://github.com/Tribler/tribler) to get an idea on how to do this.

__Big Data :__ the platform should allow processing linked data stored in the platform in an efficient manner from within distributed apps. For instance through integration with MonetDB/R (https://github.com/MonetDB).

__Ready for the IoT :__ With harnessing the aspects above, Discipl is ready for the internet of things in which small devices transact with each other in automated fashion.

__Ready for post-scarcity economies :__ With harnessing the aspects above, Discipl is ready for new economies in which money is actually not that important anymore and transactions are more about fulfilling all needs in an efficient and sustainable way.

__Ready for a new world :__ With harnessing the aspects above, Discipl is ready for a new world that is enfolding right now.


No, sorry, or don't worry, we know this platform does not exist (yet) and is hard to achieve. But let's try and build it! Our best guess at this moment is to have a mix of Ethereum, IOTAtoken or Tribler along with some integration with MonetDB/R and add zero knowledge proof technology like ZCash did.  But there are other great solutions too. What are your idea's?

Let us illustrate the (part)-solutions with real life use cases of today:

__Use case: Income tax chain__

Information about one's income is shared among several organizations in the public sector often with delay and decay. It is easy to see how Smart Contracts may help automate taking care of income taxes more accurately in near real time. First within government but even better together with employers and employees. Of course this would have to interface with information currently contained in several registers (BRP (register of persons), etc) and would involve information that people want to keep private (think of GDPR). You can imagine a Smart Contract through which employers would pay wages and which deducts the appropriate amount of taxes and pays out to the employee. Organizations that would need the amount of income of someone in some calculation can do that through Smart Contracts keeping this information completely private (evaluation without sharing;  bringing the calculation to the data instead of the other way around). There would be a lot of stakeholders communicating with these contracts and it would not be nice or acceptable to have to pay for each interaction. It would also be a waist of effort and capacity and therefore energy to keep track of all this, even when automated. A collaborative information platform for the commons envisioned through Discipl might make it possible in a more effective and scalable manner.

__Use case: Direct payment of childcare benefits__

In a letter to the Dutch parliament it has been stated that the advise for direct payment of childcare benefit from government to childcare organizations will not be evaluated because of privacy issues; the childcare organization would know the amount of benefit parents are receiving and therefore would know their income. It is easy to see how a Smart Contract as intermediate may help prevent this cost effectively. Through Discipl it could interface with an improved income tax chain to determine more accurately the amount parents would have to contribute for the childcare once a childcare organization would send it's invoice. And once parents have paid this part the smart contract would enable payment of the total to the childcare organization. They would not have to know what amount parents are contributing and therefore there don't have to be privacy issues with this solution.

__Use case: Treasury banking in education__

This use case revolves around treasury banking. In The Netherlands, certain government bodies and/or semi-public agencies can use the central government’s treasury as a bank. Put shortly, this means that the Ministry of Finance acts as a bank, offering to its clients a checking account as well as loans and deposits. In our use case, enter a (fictitious) school that needs a loan to have a new school building constructed. To obtain this loan and erect the school, the board will need to provide proof of meeting the minimum requirements as set by the ministry of education. Secondly, the city council and the ministry of education will need to pledge security on the loan. Once all the boxes have been ticked, the loan may be issued. This loan however consists of earmarked funds, such that this money may only be used for expenses directly relating to the construction of a new building. Other expenses, i.e. renovating an existing school or buying materials for the classrooms, are explicitly prohibited from being bought with this loan. 

Instead of a process involving several systems, paper forms and stamps and lack of control, one could think up an Dapp with the educational organization in demand of a building as main end user. Through the Dapp this end user would request a financial loan and once sanctioned by the appropriate parties could pay the companies that build the building or deliver supplies for it which on their turn can exchange it for real euro's or other currencies through this app. Of course this should enable checks whether the expenses are actually related for construction of a new building. 

Since this Dapp would be used by a lot of companies and in the end will have to interface with information sources now contained in several registers and systems and because it is all tax money, it should this should all be contained within a platform like Discipl. Note that it would be a Dapp that is usable at several places in government for numerous use cases. This is just one of them.

__Free zone__

The use cases above are actual ideas for blockchain pilots of customers of ICTU (Belastingdienst (the dutch IRS), DUO, Ministry of Finance) and are only three of numerous ideas of numerous clients. But a lot of these ideas are solving problems of the current world in which most of our effort is put in keeping track of who owes what to another out of fear others might get more while doing less work. All this effort and distrust is a waist and does not help make this world a better place. Shouldn't we focus on automating the production and distribution of real value? A shift to a new sustainable post-scarcity economy with abundance and choice is not something that takes place over night, and probably it shouldn't. But putting a platform like Discipl in place wouldn't also. We sure can focus on it however and set some first steps in this inevitable transition. Discipl is actually already such a step. We would appreciate any other use case on top of it that somehow fits this view. 

__What's next__

You can expect a better version of the Discipl website (http://www.discipl.org) and more info here on Github about Discipl and the use case's explained above. We will keep you posted. If you've any question: feel free to contact us through the blockchainhackathon.eu site or info@discipl.org
